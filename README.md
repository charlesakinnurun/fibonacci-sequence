## Fibonacci Sequence
<p>The Fibonacci Sequence is one of the most famous formulas in mathematics. It’s a simple series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.<p>
<p>The sequence usually starts like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...<p>

### The Formula
<p>In mathematical terms, the sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:<p>
$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$

With the seed values:
- $F_0 = 0$
- $F_1 = 1$

### The Golden Ratio ($\phi$)
<p>As the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence get higher, the ratio between two consecutive numbers approaches the Golden Ratio, which is approximately 1.618.</p>

<p>This ratio is found throughout nature, art, and architecture because it is visually pleasing and allows for efficient growth patterns.</p>

### Where You’ll See It in Nature
<p>The Fibonacci sequence isn't just a classroom exercise; it appears in the physical world in fascinating ways:</p>

- Flower Petals: Most flowers have a petal count that is a Fibonacci number (e.g., lilies have 3, buttercups have 5, delphiniums have 8).

- Pinecones and Sunflowers: The seeds grow in opposing spirals. If you count the clockwise and counter-clockwise spirals, they are almost always consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

- Shells: The "Golden Spiral" (based on Fibonacci squares) is famously seen in the shell of the chambered nautilus.

- Galaxies: The spiral arms of the Milky Way and other galaxies often follow the path of the Golden Spiral.
